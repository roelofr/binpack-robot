# Binpacking Robot

This Java program, which has been written 2 years ago in about 8 weeks in my
first year of Computer Science. The code doesn't have a lot of documentation and
I've uploaded it mainly for archive purposes and for other IT students to learn
something about.

# What does it do?

The application is supposed to communicate with 2 Arduino Unos, which have been
flashed with the right software (see the wiki). The two Arduinos should both
drive two motors, where Ardiuno one is supposed to run the motor to switch
between the bins (either bin A or bin B) and the long-distance motor. The other
robot is supposed to move the warehouse arm up and down and extend / retract the
pickup arm.

Sadly, without the exact right dimensions (which we don't have), it's really
hard to make this application do what it did 2 years ago.
